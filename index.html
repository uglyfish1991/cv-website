            <p>My name is Katherine Long, but I am known as Klong. I am a Junior Instructor with Code Nation. I was a Deputy Stage Manager for approximately 10 years, until a fall from height left me with an injury and a fear of heights, and I found myself needing a new career path. I joined Knowsley Safari Park in March 2020 as a Guest Engagement Presenter delivering talks and tours to schools and visitors, but due to world events, that role was stopped. I remained in the park as a steward/janitor but found that my injuries really prevented me from enjoying my role - which included a huge amount of walking!</p>
            <p>In January 2021, I attended a 3-week coding course that I'd seen on Reddit with Code Nation. I completed the course, and had a wonderful time meeting new people and gaining new skills. Shortly after, Code Nation contacted me asking me to join their team, and I have remained there to the present.</p>

            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, chess, attending gigs, and rugby league. I play the trumpet, the violin, the guitar, and I can muddle through music on a piano. I study Marine Biology part time, and am hoping to combine my interests in development and conservation. I can't swim.</p>
